##About
<img align="right" width="50%" src="https://i.imgur.com/vtOep1f.png">
>rcloneExplorer works by taking output from rclone, which does all the heavy lifting. Remotes which have been set up via rclones config proces should be fully usable in rcloneExplorer.
rcloneExplorer can only access rclone configured remotes.

###GUI for Config Management
<img align="right" width="50%" src="https://i.imgur.com/1BpaGTM.png">
><p>A lot of people seem intimidated by the rclone CLI, especially during the initial configuration. In an attempt to remedy this rcloneExplorer now has an easy to use configuration 'wizard' which can be used to manage remotes and encryption settings</p>
